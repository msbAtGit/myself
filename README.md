## My Personal Website..WORK IN PROGRESS
### Stuffs I create or hear or things which I explore or learn so that I can be a better teacher and a software engineer. 
#### I find coding to be more fun and purposeful as long as we are clear as to which problem we are trying to solve using technology and integrating technology in a problem space
##### This page is my experiments with my own thought about technology and using HTML as my language of expression in the software world.
